# Example Project for Terraform, Saltstack, Consul and DigitalOcean

## About

This started out as an example on how to use the following three software packages in a tutorial:

   * http://terraform.io/[Terraform^] - spin up new servers and orchestrate resources in the cloud from a simple text file.

   * https://www.digitalocean.com/[DigitalOcean^] - a cloud provider. Use their API to spin up virtual servers as needed.

   * http://docs.saltstack.com/[SaltStack's Salt^] - install and manage software on a server. With it's cloud add-on it can also spin up new servers in the cloud.

   * https://consul.io/[Consul^] - service discovery and monitoring in the cloud.

This setup will show you a setup where a ngix load balancer distributes the load between multiple web servers.

There is a <<tutorial/tutorial.adoc#doc,full tutorial>> in the `tutorial` sub folder on how to do this.

For experienced users there is a <<cheatsheet.adoc#doc,minimal set of instructions>> in `cheatsheet.adoc`.
