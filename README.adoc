# Example Project for Terraform, Salt, Consul and DigitalOcean

image:https://travis-ci.org/ahus1/saltconsul-examples.svg["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.org/ahus1/saltconsul-examples"]

## About

This started out as an example on how to use the following three software packages in a tutorial:

   * http://terraform.io/[HashiCorp's Terraform^] - spin up new servers and orchestrate resources in the cloud from a simple text file.

   * https://www.digitalocean.com/[DigitalOcean^] - a cloud provider. Use their API to spin up virtual servers as needed.

   * http://docs.saltstack.com/[SaltStack's Salt^] - install and manage software on a server. With it's cloud add-on it can also spin up new servers in the cloud.

   * https://consul.io/[HashiCorp's Consul^] - service discovery and monitoring in the cloud.

This setup will show you a setup where a ngix load balancer distributes the load between multiple web servers.

There is a http://ahus1.github.io/saltconsul-examples/tutorial.html[full tutorial^] available online.
The sources for this tutorial are in the `tutorial` sub folder of this project.

For experienced users there is a <<cheatsheet{ext-relative}#cheat-sheet,minimal set of instructions>> in `cheatsheet.adoc`.
