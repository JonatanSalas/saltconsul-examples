## Getting started

In order to get started you'll need to register yourself at the cloud provider DigitalOcean and create yourself a SSH key. 

### Project's directory

Please create an empty directory on your hard drive. Please place all files you create inside this directory or in sub directories.

Please avoid blanks or other special characters in the path name. This might confuse some programs.

### Setup Git

It's a good practice to save intermediate states when you work with source code files. To do this it is very handy to use git.

Please install https://tortoisegit.org/[TortoiseGit^] to do this. Please choose "Git Create repository here..." from your Explorer's context menu to setup a local Git repository. This will not be shared with anybody. But it allows you to go back to any previous step during this tutorial. Please commit the current state of your work after every step to be able to do this.

### Create a SSH key

When you want to access a command line on a linux server, you'll use secure shell (SSH) to access it. It is possible to use a username and password combination to log in. The more secure way is to use a public/private key pair. This has the following advantages:

. A private key is _very_ long, and therefore it can't be guessed.

. You can give away your public key to multiple servers to log in. Even if one of the servers is being compromised no-one will be able to impersonate yourself with the public key.

To do that please download http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html[PuTTY and PuTTYgen^]. Even if you already have a keypair, use the time to create a key pair just for this tutorial.

Once you run it, you'll see the following dialoge shown in <<img-puttygen-createkey>>.

[[img-puttygen-createkey]]
image::puttygen_createkey.png[title="Creating a key with puttygen"]

Please note the following settings:

. The key type needs to be set to `SSH-2 RSA`. DSA will not work as it is not supported by DigitalOcean.

. The number of bits in a generated key should be set to 2048. This key length will provide a very good level of security.

Press btn:[Generate] and follow the instruction on the screen to create your key.

You'll now need to save your private and your public key.

There are different formats to save your keys. In these examples you'll need the OpenSSH format.
This tutorial will not use a password for your keys.

Please proceed as follows:

* create a local file called `id_rsa.pub` in the project folder. Copy the contents of the field labled "Public key for pasting into ..." into this file. It should be one long line that looks like this:

-----
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2E...ANqTeH4scPYaQ== rsa-key-20150527
-----

* Choose menu:Conversions[Export OpenSSH key] to export your private key in the OpenSSH format. Choose `id_rsa` as a filename and save it the project folder. It should be multiple lines that that looks like this:

---------
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEoQIBAAKCAQEAxet1I80forMqWAj1gCexHQLoikdlMjUl8vM498vdfqrO1dHE
...
ZCRXXL2Q5mlJDSekPLRnrgPervaWBVW8v9Bqgybp9qIigDAQxA==
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
---------

* Choose btn:[Save private key] to export your private key. Choose `id_rsa.ppk` as a filename and save it the project folder. It should be multiple lines that that looks like this:

---------
PuTTY-User-Key-File-2: ssh-rsa
...
Private-MAC: da8565a7228c35643a0047b001eafafb496e70f1
---------

* Please also save the fingerprint in a separate file. You'll need that fingerprint later. Please save it in a file called `id_rsa.fingerprint`. It should look like this:

---------
ssh-rsa 2048 c8:df:df:...:83:d9:41:ce
---------

### Register at DigitalOcean

In order to run your virtual machines in the cloud you'll need to set up an account with a hosting provider.
DigitalOcean is used in this example. It specializes in running virtual machines in the cloud. For this they have multiple data centers around the world. In April 2015 they have opened a data center in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. There are almost no additional services except hosting DNS entries. This will give us the clear view we'll need today.

Please use the following afiliate link to register at DigitalOcean: https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=532ccb598c03.
Using this link you'll automatically receive 10 USD credit. If you have registered before, or if you haven't received the credit, you could try to redemm `ALLSSD10` as a promo code to receive 10 USD credit.

Once you have registered you should add some extra safety to you account by activating http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator[Google Authenticator^]. When you activate it, you will need in addition to username and password also a token that is created by an app on your mobile phone. This way no-one can log in to your DigitalOcean account with only your username and password.

In the https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/security[security settings of DigitalOcean^] you should set up two-factor-authentication. You'll need to https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447[install Google Authenticator on a mobile device^] to create a PIN code whenever you log in to your DigitalOcean account.

After you have registered you'll need register a payment method, for example a credit card. This is a matter of authenticating yourself.

As we'll want to script everything we do in the following steps, please create an API token. This needs to be a token with read and write access. You'll pass on this token to all programs that will access your account. At any point in time you can revoke it without changing your main password.

// TODO: add link to API key creation

### Preparations for Terraform

The next tool we'll use will output ANSI escape characters on your screen. While Linux terminals support it, Windows doesn't. To fix this please https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon/releases[download the ANSICON tool^].

Once downloaded, extract the contents to a `bin` subfolder of your project's directory. Open a command shell and run `bin\ansicon` once to enable ANSI transformations.

### Setup of Terraform and creating a first virtual machine

Terraform can be used to orchestrate multiple resources in the cloud. A text file is used to describe the configuration you want to have and you can then set up of tear down the whole setup in one step.

Terraform is distributed as a set of binaries. When you're running Windows, download `terraform_0.4.2_windows_amd64.zip` from Terraform's website https://www.terraform.io/.

Extract all files to a subdirectory called `bin` in your project's folder. Please open a command line in your project's folder and run `bin\terraform`. This will print out short usage instructions on how to use it.

Please create a first configuration file for Terraform called `saltmaster.tf`. In this file we'll put all the information necessary to setup the first host in the cloud.

[source,json]
.saltmaster.tf
----
include::../../saltmaster.tf[tags=setupkey]
----

Sidenote: if you want to put your secret and personal information in a separate file, please see the https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/override.html[override configuration of Terraform^]. This allows you to have a separate file `saltmaster_override.tf` with all the secret stuff that you can avoid to check in to a repository.

[source,json]
.saltmaster_override.tf
----
include::../../saltmaster_override.tf.sample[tags=setupkey]
----

Now run `bin\terraform plan` on the command line. When everything in your file is spelled correctly, Terraform prints a plan of the steps it will perform to create the described infrastructure for you.

Once you are happy with it, run `bin\terraform apply`.

You will see the output of Terraform on the console. When you check DigitalOcean's web console, you'll see that the first "Droplet" has been created. In you account settings you also see that a SSH key has been registered with your account.

You can see the IP address of the new server in the output of the Terraform command. At any time later you can look up the server DigitalOcean's web console, or use `bin\terraform show` to show the state of the currently created resources.

Terraform has created a local file called `terraform.tfstate` that includes a machine readable description of the previously created resources.

Use `terraform show` to get a list of all resources that have been created.
If you want to re-create the server, you can use `bin\terraform taint <resourcename>` and any point.
To issue this for the machine we have just created use `bin\terraform taint digitalocean_droplet.master`
When you the issue another `bin\terraform apply` command, the resource will be deleted and re-created.

Perform the following steps to connect to your new newly created machine:

. Start Putty.

. In the first screen with the settings enter the IP address of your newly created machine in the cloud.

. See <<img-putty-keyauth>> on where enter your private key. Then click on btn:[Open] to connect to your machine.

. Use `root` as the user name whe you log in. You should not be asked for a password if everything has been setup correctly.

Congratulations! You have now set up automatically a server in the cloud. And as everything has been scripted, it is totally reproducable. Try out yourself with different combinations of `apply`, `taint` and `destroy` to get yourself familiar with this setup.
